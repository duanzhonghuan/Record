## qt问题 

1、请问我在QGraphicsScene中放置了一些QGraphicsObject，但是鼠标放在这些QGraphicsObject上面时，QGraphicsObject这个对象下并没有收到hoverEnterEvent事件，而且我也设置了setAcceptHoverEvents(true).

> setFlags(QGraphicsItem::ItemIsSelectable |
>        QGraphicsItem::ItemIsMovable |
>        QGraphicsItem::ItemIsFocusable);



2、请问下，我在QGraphicsScene中放置一些items（继承于QGraphicsObject）,可以画在上面，但是鼠标为啥无法选中呢，QGraphicsScene这一层可以收到mousepress事件，但是items这一层时钟收不到这个mousepress事件

> @Jason Wang 大佬，那个进不去hoverenterevent事件的问题，我找到了，好像是我的scene的坐标没有设置好，导致响应点不在item上![img](E:\record\Record\1.gif)



##  QGraphicsScene学习

Detailed Description

The [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) class provides a surface for managing a large number of 2D graphical items.

The class serves as a container for QGraphicsItems. It is used together with [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) for visualizing graphical items, such as lines, rectangles, text, or even custom items, on a 2D surface. [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) is part of the [Graphics View Framework](graphicsview.html).

[QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) also provides functionality that lets you efficiently determine both the location of items, and for determining what items are visible within an arbitrary area on the scene. With the [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) widget, you can either visualize the whole scene, or zoom in and view only parts of the scene.

Example:

```

  QGraphicsScene scene;
  scene.addText("Hello, world!");

  QGraphicsView view(&scene);
  view.show();

```

Note that [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) has no visual appearance of its own; it only manages the items. You need to create a [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) widget to visualize the scene.

To add items to a scene, you start off by constructing a [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) object. Then, you have two options: either add your existing [QGraphicsItem](qgraphicsitem.html) objects by calling [addItem](qgraphicsscene.html#addItem)(), or you can call one of the convenience functions [addEllipse](qgraphicsscene.html#addEllipse)(), [addLine](qgraphicsscene.html#addLine)(), [addPath](qgraphicsscene.html#addPath)(), [addPixmap](qgraphicsscene.html#addPixmap)(), [addPolygon](qgraphicsscene.html#addPolygon)(), [addRect](qgraphicsscene.html#addRect)(), or [addText](qgraphicsscene.html#addText)(), which all return a pointer to the newly added item. The dimensions of the items added with these functions are relative to the item's coordinate system, and the items position is initialized to (0, 0) in the scene.

You can then visualize the scene using [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html). When the scene changes, (e.g., when an item moves or is transformed) [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) emits the [changed](qgraphicsscene.html#changed)() signal. To remove an item, call [removeItem](qgraphicsscene.html#removeItem)().

[QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) uses an indexing algorithm to manage the location of items efficiently. By default, a BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) tree is used; an algorithm suitable for large scenes where most items remain static (i.e., do not move around). You can choose to disable this index by calling [setItemIndexMethod](qgraphicsscene.html#itemIndexMethod-prop)(). For more information about the available indexing algorithms, see the [itemIndexMethod](qgraphicsscene.html#itemIndexMethod-prop) property.

The scene's bounding rect is set by calling [setSceneRect](qgraphicsscene.html#sceneRect-prop)(). Items can be placed at any position on the scene, and the size of the scene is by default unlimited. The scene rect is used only for internal bookkeeping, maintaining the scene's item index. If the scene rect is unset, [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) will use the bounding area of all items, as returned by [itemsBoundingRect](qgraphicsscene.html#itemsBoundingRect)(), as the scene rect. However, [itemsBoundingRect](qgraphicsscene.html#itemsBoundingRect)() is a relatively time consuming function, as it operates by collecting positional information for every item on the scene. Because of this, you should always set the scene rect when operating on large scenes.

One of [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html)'s greatest strengths is its ability to efficiently determine the location of items. Even with millions of items on the scene, the [items](qgraphicsscene.html#items)() functions can determine the location of an item within a few milliseconds. There are several overloads to [items](qgraphicsscene.html#items)(): one that finds items at a certain position, one that finds items inside or intersecting with a polygon or a rectangle, and more. The list of returned items is sorted by stacking order, with the topmost item being the first item in the list. For convenience, there is also an [itemAt](qgraphicsscene.html#itemAt)() function that returns the topmost item at a given position.

[QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) maintains selection information for the scene. To select items, call [setSelectionArea](qgraphicsscene.html#setSelectionArea)(), and to clear the current selection, call [clearSelection](qgraphicsscene.html#clearSelection)(). Call [selectedItems](qgraphicsscene.html#selectedItems)() to get the list of all selected items. 

Event Handling and Propagation

Another responsibility that [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) has, is to propagate events from [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html). To send an event to a scene, you construct an event that inherits [QEvent](../qtcore/qevent.html), and then send it using, for example, QApplication::sendEvent(). [event](qgraphicsscene.html#event)() is responsible for dispatching the event to the individual items. Some common events are handled by convenience event handlers. For example, key press events are handled by [keyPressEvent](qgraphicsscene.html#keyPressEvent)(), and mouse press events are handled by [mousePressEvent](qgraphicsscene.html#mousePressEvent)().

Key events are delivered to the *focus item*. To set the focus item, you can either call [setFocusItem](qgraphicsscene.html#setFocusItem)(), passing an item that accepts focus, or the item itself can call [QGraphicsItem::setFocus](qgraphicsitem.html#setFocus)(). Call [focusItem](qgraphicsscene.html#focusItem)() to get the current focus item. For compatibility with widgets, the scene also maintains its own focus information. By default, the scene does not have focus, and all key events are discarded. If [setFocus](qgraphicsscene.html#setFocus)() is called, or if an item on the scene gains focus, the scene automatically gains focus. If the scene has focus, [hasFocus](qgraphicsscene.html#hasFocus)() will return true, and key events will be forwarded to the focus item, if any. If the scene loses focus, (i.e., someone calls [clearFocus](qgraphicsscene.html#clearFocus)()) while an item has focus, the scene will maintain its item focus information, and once the scene regains focus, it will make sure the last focus item regains focus.

For mouse-over effects, [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) dispatches *hover events*. If an item accepts hover events (see [QGraphicsItem::acceptHoverEvents](qgraphicsitem.html#acceptHoverEvents)()), it will receive a [GraphicsSceneHoverEnter](../qtcore/qevent.html#Type-enum) event when the mouse enters its area. As the mouse continues moving inside the item's area, [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) will send it [GraphicsSceneHoverMove](../qtcore/qevent.html#Type-enum) events. When the mouse leaves the item's area, the item will receive a [GraphicsSceneHoverLeave](../qtcore/qevent.html#Type-enum) event.

All mouse events are delivered to the current *mouse grabber* item. An item becomes the scene's mouse grabber if it accepts mouse events (see [QGraphicsItem::acceptedMouseButtons](qgraphicsitem.html#acceptedMouseButtons)()) and it receives a mouse press. It stays the mouse grabber until it receives a mouse release when no other mouse buttons are pressed. You can call [mouseGrabberItem](qgraphicsscene.html#mouseGrabberItem)() to determine what item is currently grabbing the mouse.

##  QGraphicsView学习

Detailed Description

The [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) class provides a widget for displaying the contents of a [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html).

[QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) visualizes the contents of a [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html) in a scrollable viewport. To create a scene with geometrical items, see [QGraphicsScene](qgraphicsscene.html)'s documentation. [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) is part of the [Graphics View Framework](graphicsview.html).

To visualize a scene, you start by constructing a [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) object, passing the address of the scene you want to visualize to [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html)'s constructor. Alternatively, you can call [setScene](qgraphicsview.html#setScene)() to set the scene at a later point. After you call [show](qwidget.html#show)(), the view will by default scroll to the center of the scene and display any items that are visible at this point. For example:

```

  QGraphicsScene scene;
  scene.addText("Hello, world!");

  QGraphicsView view(&scene);
  view.show();

```

You can explicitly scroll to any position on the scene by using the scroll bars, or by calling [centerOn](qgraphicsview.html#centerOn)(). By passing a point to [centerOn](qgraphicsview.html#centerOn)(), [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) will scroll its viewport to ensure that the point is centered in the view. An overload is provided for scrolling to a [QGraphicsItem](qgraphicsitem.html), in which case [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) will see to that the center of the item is centered in the view. If all you want is to ensure that a certain area is visible, (but not necessarily centered,) you can call [ensureVisible](qgraphicsview.html#ensureVisible)() instead.

[QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) can be used to visualize a whole scene, or only parts of it. The visualized area is by default detected automatically when the view is displayed for the first time (by calling [QGraphicsScene::itemsBoundingRect](qgraphicsscene.html#itemsBoundingRect)()). To set the visualized area rectangle yourself, you can call [setSceneRect](qgraphicsview.html#sceneRect-prop)(). This will adjust the scroll bars' ranges appropriately. Note that although the scene supports a virtually unlimited size, the range of the scroll bars will never exceed the range of an integer (INT_MIN, INT_MAX).

[QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) visualizes the scene by calling [render](qgraphicsview.html#render)(). By default, the items are drawn onto the viewport by using a regular [QPainter](../qtgui/qpainter.html), and using default render hints. To change the default render hints that [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) passes to [QPainter](../qtgui/qpainter.html) when painting items, you can call [setRenderHints](qgraphicsview.html#renderHints-prop)().

By default, [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) provides a regular [QWidget](qwidget.html) for the viewport widget. You can access this widget by calling [viewport](qabstractscrollarea.html#viewport)(), or you can replace it by calling [setViewport](qabstractscrollarea.html#setViewport)(). To render using OpenGL, simply call [setViewport](qabstractscrollarea.html#setViewport)(new QGLWidget). [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) takes ownership of the viewport widget.

[QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) supports affine transformations, using [QTransform](../qtgui/qtransform.html). You can either pass a matrix to [setTransform](qgraphicsview.html#setTransform)(), or you can call one of the convenience functions [rotate](qgraphicsview.html#rotate)(), [scale](qgraphicsview.html#scale)(), [translate](qgraphicsview.html#translate)() or [shear](qgraphicsview.html#shear)(). The most two common transformations are scaling, which is used to implement zooming, and rotation. [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) keeps the center of the view fixed during a transformation. Because of the scene alignment (setAligment()), translating the view will have no visual impact.

You can interact with the items on the scene by using the mouse and keyboard. [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) translates the mouse and key events into *scene* events, (events that inherit [QGraphicsSceneEvent](qgraphicssceneevent.html),), and forward them to the visualized scene. In the end, it's the individual item that handles the events and reacts to them. For example, if you click on a selectable item, the item will typically let the scene know that it has been selected, and it will also redraw itself to display a selection rectangle. Similiary, if you click and drag the mouse to move a movable item, it's the item that handles the mouse moves and moves itself. Item interaction is enabled by default, and you can toggle it by calling [setInteractive](qgraphicsview.html#interactive-prop)().

You can also provide your own custom scene interaction, by creating a subclass of [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html), and reimplementing the mouse and key event handlers. To simplify how you programmatically interact with items in the view, [QGraphicsView](qgraphicsview.html) provides the mapping functions [mapToScene](qgraphicsview.html#mapToScene)() and [mapFromScene](qgraphicsview.html#mapFromScene)(), and the item accessors [items](qgraphicsview.html#items)() and [itemAt](qgraphicsview.html#itemAt)(). These functions allow you to map points, rectangles, polygons and paths between view coordinates and scene coordinates, and to find items on the scene using view coordinates.
